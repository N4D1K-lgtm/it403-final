        <h2>Understanding Excessive Inheritance</h2>
        <p>
          Excessive Inheritance is a sin that occurs when inheritance is
          overused, leading to deep and complex object hierarchies. This
          approach often results in classes inheriting properties or behaviors
          they don't need, which can tack on unused methods and properties. In
          some cases, inheritance can actually force boilerplate implementations
          of methods irrelevant to the functionality of the class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deep inheritance hierarchies can make the codebase incredibly
          difficult to refactor. Developers must navigate through multiple
          layers of classes to understand how a particular method or property is
          being used or overridden. They also tend to teach programmers never to
          mess with a parent class for fear of a ripple of unforeseen
          consequences. I personally have spent many hours shoehorning a
          specific edge-case class implementation into inheriting from a given
          parent class, only to completely rewrite the class from scratch
          without inheritance. (which defeats the entire purpose)
        </p>
        <p>
          A common misconception in OOP is that inheritance is the primary means
          to achieve

          and code reuseability. However, composition is often a more flexible
          and maintainable alternative. Composition involves building classes
          from other classes through relationships, rather than extending them
          through inheritance. This approach allows for more modular and
          decoupled design, where objects are composed of other objects with
          well-defined interfaces, rather than inheriting all properties and
          behaviors I highly recommend watching this video:

      <section class="examples">
        <h2>Example: Over-Extended User Account Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>UserAccount</code> class hierarchy demonstrates excessive
          inheritance, where subclasses inherit and override methods and
          properties, leading to a rigid and complex structure.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-csharp">public class UserAccount
{
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; }
    public virtual void Login() { /* ... */ }
    public virtual void Logout() { /* ... */ }
}

public class AdminAccount : UserAccount
{
    public override void Login() { /* Admin-specific login logic */ }
    public void AccessControlPanel() { /* ... */ }
}

public class GuestAccount : UserAccount
{
    public override void Login() { /* Guest-specific login logic */ }
    public override void Logout() { /* Guest-specific logout logic */ }
}

public class PremiumAccount : UserAccount
{
    public override void Login() { /* Premium account login logic */ }
    public void AccessPremiumFeatures() { /* ... */ }
}

        <h3>Refactored Solution</h3>
        <p>
          The refactored approach uses composition over inheritance. Instead of
          extending the <code>UserAccount</code> class, we create separate
          classes for different functionalities and compose them as needed. This
          more accurately models the real-world relationship between a user
          account and it's types and behaviors.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you've been paying attention, you would have noticed I have been
          using composition in almost all of my examples for the other sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a real-world scenario I would reccomend using interfaces to
          describe a "contract" that the associated objects have to fulfill.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-csharp">public class UserAccount
{
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; }
    public LoginBehavior LoginBehavior { get; set; }
    public LogoutBehavior LogoutBehavior { get; set; }
    public void Login() { LoginBehavior.Login(this); }
    public void Logout() { LogoutBehavior.Logout(this); }
}

public class AdminAccount
{
    public UserAccount UserAccount { get; set; }
    public void AccessControlPanel() { /* ... */ }
}

public class PremiumAccount
{
    public UserAccount UserAccount { get; set; }
    public void AccessPremiumFeatures() { /* ... */ }
}

// we can also combine the two classes above into one very easily
public class AdminPremiumAccount {
    public UserAccount UserAccount { get; set; }
    public void AccessControlPanel() { /* ... */ }
    public void AccessPremiumFeatures() { /* ... */ }
}
// Classes for LoginBehavior, LogoutBehavior, etc.
